<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
	<t>The document "Autonomic Networking - Definitions and Design Goals" <xref target="RFC7575"/> explains the fundamental concepts behind Autonomic Networking, and defines the relevant terms in this space. In section 5 it describes a high level reference model. This document defines this reference model with more detail, to allow for functional and protocol specifications to be developed in an architecturally consistent, non-overlapping manner. While the document is written as generally as possible, the initial solutions are limited to the chartered scope of the WG.</t>
	<t>As discussed in <xref target="RFC7575"/>, the goal of this work is not to focus exclusively on fully autonomic nodes or networks. In reality, most networks will run with some autonomic functions, while the rest of the network is traditionally managed. This reference model allows for this hybrid approach. </t>
	<t>This is a living document and will evolve with the technical solutions developed in the ANIMA WG. Sections marked with (*) do not represent current charter items. While this document must give a long term architectural view, not all functions will be standardized at the same time.</t>

<section anchor="network" title="The Network View">
	<t>This section describes the various elements in a network with autonomic functions, and how these entities work together, on a high level. Subsequent sections explain the detailed inside view for each of the autonomic network elements, as well as the network functions (or interfaces) between those elements. </t>
				
	<t><xref target="network-view"/> shows the high level view of an Autonomic Network. It consists of a number of autonomic nodes, which interact directly with each other. Those autonomic nodes provide a common set of capabilities across the network, called the "Autonomic Networking Infrastructure" (ANI). The ANI provides functions like naming, addressing, negotiation, synchronization, discovery and messaging. </t>
	
	<t>Autonomic functions typically span several, possibly all nodes in the network. The atomic entities of an autonomic function are called the "Autonomic Service Agents" (ASA), which are instantiated on nodes. </t>

	<t>In a horizontal view, autonomic functions span across the network, as well as the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure. In a vertical view, a node always implements the ANI, plus it may have one or several Autonomic Service Agents. </t>
	<t>The Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) therefore is the foundation for autonomic functions. The current charter of the ANIMA WG is to specify the ANI, using a few autonomic functions as use cases. </t>

			<t>This section describes an autonomic network element and its internal architecture. The reference model explained in <xref target="I-D.irtf-nmrg-autonomic-network-definitions"/> shows the sources of information that an autonomic service agent can leverage: Self-knowledge, network knowledge (through discovery), Intent, and feedback loops. Fundamentally, there are two levels inside an autonomic node: the level of Autonomic Service Agents, and the level of the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure, with the former using the services of the latter. <xref target="ref_model"/> illustrates this concept.

	<section anchor="addressing" title="Addressing">
		<t>Autonomic Service Agents (ASAs) need to communicate with each other, using the autonomic addressing of the node they reside on. This section describes the addressing approach of the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure, used by ASAs. It does NOT describe addressing approaches for the data plane of the network, which may be configured and managed in the traditional way, or negotiated as a service of an ASA. One use case for such an autonomic function is described in <xref target="I-D.jiang-auto-addr-management"/>.  The addressing of the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure is in scope for this section, the address space they negotiate for the data plane is not. </t>
		<t>Autonomic addressing is a function of the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (lower part of <xref target="ref_model"/>), specifically the Autonomic Control Plane. ASAs do not have their own addresses. They may use either API calls, or the autonomic addressing scheme of the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure. </t>

		<t>An autonomic addressing scheme has the following requirements: 
		<list style="symbols">
			<t>Zero-touch for simple networks: Simple networks should have complete self-management of addressing, and not require any central address management, tools, or address planning. </t>
			<t>Low-touch for complex networks: If complex networks require operator input for autonomic address management, it should be limited to high level guidance only, expressed in Intent.</t>
			<t>Flexibility: The addressing scheme must be flexible enough for nodes to be able to move around, for the network to grow, split and merge. </t>
			<t>Robustness: It should be as hard as possible for an administrator to negatively affect addressing (and thus connectivity) in the autonomic context. </t>
			<t>Support for virtualization: Autonomic Nodes may support Autonomic Service Agents in different virtual machines or containers. The addressing scheme should support this architecture. </t>
			<t>Simplicity: To make engineering simpler, and to give the human administrator an easy way to trouble-shoot autonomic functions. </t>
			<t>Scale: The proposed scheme should work in any network of any size. </t> 
			<t>Upgradability: The scheme must be able to support different addressing concepts in the future. </t>
		</list>
		</t>

		<t>The primary use for the autonomically managed addressing described here is for the Autonomic Control Plane (<xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane"/>). The fundamental concepts, as well as the proposed addressing scheme for the ACP is discussed in <xref target="I-D.behringer-anima-autonomic-addressing"/>. </t>

	</section>
	<!-- addressing -->

	<section anchor="discovery" title="Discovery">
			<t>Traditionally, most of the information a node requires is provided through configuration or northbound interfaces. An autonomic function should rely on such northbound interfaces minimally or not at all, and therefore it needs to discover peers and other resources in the network. This section describes various discovery functions in an autonomic network.</t>

			<t>Discovering nodes and their properties and capabilities: A core function to establish an autonomic domain is the mutual discovery of autonomic nodes, primarily adjacent nodes and secondarily off-link peers. This may in principle either leverage existing discovery mechanisms, or use new mechanisms tailored to the autonomic context. An important point is that discovery must work in a network with no predefined topology, ideally no manual configuration of any kind, and with nodes starting up from factory condition or after any form of failure or sudden topology change.</t>
			
			<t>Discovering services: Network services such as AAA should also be discovered and not configured. Service discovery is required for such tasks. An autonomic network can either leverage existing service discovery functions, or use a new approach, or a mixture.</t>

			<t>Thus the discovery mechanism could either be fully integrated with autonomic signaling (next section) or could use an independent discovery mechanism such as DNS Service Discovery or Service Location Protocol. This choice could be made independently for each Autonomic Service Agent, although the infrastructure might require some minimal lowest common denominator (e.g., for discovering the security bootstrap mechanism, or the source of intent distribution, <xref target="intent-distri"/>).</t>
	</section>
	<!-- discovery -->

	<section anchor="negotiation" title="Signaling Between Autonomic Nodes">
			<t>Autonomic nodes must communicate with each other, for example to negotiate and/or synchronize technical objectives (i.e., network parameters) of any kind and complexity. This requires some form of signaling between autonomic nodes. Autonomic nodes implementing a specific use case might choose their own signaling protocol, as long as it fits the overall security model. However, in the general case, any pair of autonomic nodes might need to communicate, so there needs to be a generic protocol for this. A prerequisite for this is that autonomic nodes can discover each other without any preconfiguration, as mentioned above. To be generic, discovery and signaling must be able to handle any sort of technical objective, including ones that require complex data structures. The document "A Generic Discovery and Negotiation Protocol for Autonomic Networking" <xref target="I-D.carpenter-anima-gdn-protocol"/> describes more detailed requirements for discovery, negotiation and synchronization in an autonomic network. It also defines a protocol, GDNP, for this purpose, including an integrated but optional discovery protocol.</t>
	</section>
	<!-- negotiation -->
		
	<section anchor="intent-distri" title="Intent Distribution">
		<t>Intent is the policy language of an Autonomic Network; see <xref target="intent"/> for general information on Intent. The distribution of Intent is also a function of the Autonomic Control Plane. It is expected that Intent will be expressed as quite complex human-readable data structures, and the distribution mechanism must be able to support that. Some Intent items will need to be flooded to most or all nodes, and other items of Intent may only be needed by a few nodes. Various methods could be used to distribute Intent across an autonomic domain. One approach is to treat it like any other technical objective needing to be synchronized across a set of nodes. In that case the autonomic signaling protocol could be used (previous section).</t>

	<!-- intent-distri -->

	<section anchor="routing" title="Routing">
		<t>All autonomic nodes in a domain must be able to communicate with each other, and with autonomic nodes outside their own domain. Therefore, an Autonomic Control Plane relies on a routing function. For Autonomic Networks to be interoperable, they must all support one common routing protocol. </t>
	</section>
	<!-- routing -->

	<section anchor="acp" title="The Autonomic Control Plane">
		<t>The totality of autonomic interactions forms the "Autonomic Control Plane". This control plane can be either implemented in the global routing table of a node, such as IGPs in today's networks; or it can be provided as an overlay network. The document "An Autonomic Control Plane" (<xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane"/>) describes the details. </t>

<section anchor="trust" title="Security and Trust Infrastructure">
	<t>An Autonomic Network is self-protecting. All protocols are secure by default, without the requirement for the administrator to explicitly configure security. </t>
	<t>Autonomic nodes have direct interactions between themselves, which must be secured. Since an autonomic network does not rely on configuration, it is not an option to configure for example pre-shared keys. A trust infrastructure such as a PKI infrastructure must be in place. This section describes the principles of this trust infrastructure. </t>

<section anchor="management" title="Management and Programmability">
	<t>This section describes how an Autonomic Network is managed, and programmed.</t>
		
	<section anchor="management-general" title="How an AN Network Is Managed">
		<t>Autonomic management usually co-exists with traditional management methods in most networks. Thus, autonomic behavior will be defined for individual functions in most environments. In fact, the co-existence is twofold: autonomic functions can use traditional methods and protocols (e.g., SNMP and NETCONF) to perform management tasks; and autonomic functions can conflict with behavior enforced by the same traditional methods and protocols. </t>
		<t>The autonomic intent is defined at a high level of abstraction. However, since it is necessary to address individual managed elements, autonomic management needs to communicate in lower-level interactions (e.g., commands and requests). For example, it is expected that the configuration of such elements be performed using NETCONF and YANG modules as well as the monitoring be executed through SNMP and MIBs.</t>
		<t>Conflict can occur between autonomic default behavior, autonomic intent, traditional management methods. Conflict resolution is achieved in autonomic management through prioritization [RFC7575]. The rationale is that manual and node-based management have a higher priority over autonomic management. Thus, the autonomic default behavior has the lowest priority, then comes the autonomic Intent (medium priority), and, finally, the highest priority is taken by  node-specific network management methods, such as the use of command line interfaces [RFC7575]. </t>

That intent is signed, time stamps, etc. Probably pointing back to <xref target="I-D.irtf-nmrg-autonomic-network-definitions"/>. (Note intent distribution is handled in <xref target="intent-distri"/>) [tbc] -->
		<t>This section describes Intent, and how it is managed. Intent and Policy-Based Network Management (PBNM) is already described inside the IETF (e.g., PCIM and SUPA) and in other SDOs (e.g., DMTF and TMF ZOOM). </t>
		<t>Intent can be describe as an abstract, declarative, high-level policy used to operate an autonomic domain, such as an enterprise network [RFC7575]. Intent should be limited to high level guidance only, thus it does not directly define a policy for every network element separately. In an ideal autonomic domain, only one intent provided by human administrators is necessary to operate such domain [RFC7576]. However, it is als expected intent definition from autonomic function(s) and even from traditional network management elements (e.g., OSS). </t> 
		<t>Intent can be refined to lower level policies using different approaches, such as Policy Continuum model [ref]. This is expected in order to adapt the intent to the capabilities of managed devices. In this context, intent may contain role or function information, which can be translated to specific nodes [RFC7575]. One of the possible refinements of the intent is the refinement to Event Condition Action (ECA) rules. Such rules, which are more suitable to individual entities, can be defined using different syntax and semantics. </t>
		<t>Different parameters may be configured for intents. These parameters are usually provided by the human operator. Some of these parameters can influence the behavior of specific autonomic functions as well as the way the intent is used to manage the autonomic domain (towards intended operational point). </t>
		<t>Some examples of parameters for intents are: 
		<list style="symbols">
			<t>Model version: The version of the model used to define the intent. </t>
			<t>Domain: The network scope in which the intent has effect. </t>
			<t>Name: The name of the intent which describes the intent for human operators. </t>
			<t>Version: The version of the intent, which is primarly used to control intent updates. </t>
			<t>Signature: The signature is used as a security mechanism to provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. </t>
			<t>Timestamp: The timestamp of the creation of the intent using the format supported by the IETF [TBC]. </t>
			<t>Lifetime: The lifetime in which the intent may be observed. A special case of the lifetime is the definition of permanent intents. </t>
		</list> </t>
		<t>Intent distribution is considered as one of the common control and management functions of an autonomic network [RFC7575]. Since distribution is fundamental for autonomic networking, it is necessary a mechanism to provision intent by all devices in a domain [draft-carpenter-anima-gdn-protocol]. The distribution of Intent is function of the Autonomic Control Plane and several methods can be used to distribute Intent across an autonomic domain [draft-behringer-anima-reference-model]. Intent distribution might not use the ANIMA signaling protocol itself [draft-carpenter-anima-gdn-protocol], but there is a proposal to extend such protocol for intent delivery [draft-liu-anima-intent-distribution]. </t>

	<section anchor="reporting" title="Aggregated Reporting (*)">
	<!-- <t>An autonomic network offers through the autonomic control plane the possibility to aggregate information inside the network, before sending it to the admin of the network. While this can be seen or implemented as a specific form of negotiation, the use case is different and therefore mentioned here explicitly. </t>  -->
		<t>Autonomic Network should minimize the need for human intervention. In terms of how the network should behave, this is done through an autonomic intent provided by the human administrator. In an analogous manner, the reports which describe the operational status of the network should aggregate the information produced in different network elements in order to present the effectiveness of autonomic intent enforcement. Therefore, reporting in an autonomic network should happen on a network-wide basis [RFC7575]. The information gathering and the reporting delivery should be done through the autonomic control plane. </t>
		<t>Several events can occur in an autonomic network in the same way they can happen in a traditional network. These events can be produced considering traditional network management protocols, such as SNMP and syslog. However, when reporting to a human administrator, such events should be aggregated in order to avoid advertisement about individual managed elements. In this context, algorithms may be used to determine what should be reported (e.g., filtering) and in which way and how different events are related to each other. Besides that, an event in an individual element can be compensated by changes in other elements in order to maintain in a network-wide level which is described in the autonomic intent. </t>
		<t>Reporting in an autonomic network may be in the same abstraction level of the intent. In this context, the visibility on current operational status of an autonomic network can be used to switch to different management modes. Despite the fact that autonomic management should minimize the need for user intervention, possibly there are some events that need to be addressed by human administrator actions. An alternative to model this is the use of exception-based management [RFC7575]. </t>

	<section anchor="feedback" title="Feedback Loops to NOC(*)">
		<t>Feedback loops are required in an autonomic network to allow the intervention of a human administrator or central control systems, while maintaining a default behaviour. Through a feedback loop an administrator can be prompted with a default action, and has the possibility to acknowledge or override the proposed default action.</t>
	</section>
	<!-- feedback -->

	<section anchor="control-loops" title="Control Loops (*)">
	
    <t>   Control loops are used in autonomic networking to provide a generic
   mechanism to enable the Autonomic System to adapt (on its own) to
   various factors that can change the goals that the Autonomic System
   is trying to achieve, or how those goals are achieved. For example,
   as user needs, business goals, and the ANI itself changes, self-
   adaptation enables the ANI to change the services and resources it
   makes available to adapt to these changes.</t>

   <t>Control loops operate to continuously observe and collect data
   that enables the autonomic management system to understand changes
   to the behavior of the system being managed, and then provide
   actions to move the state of the system being managed toward a
   common goal. Self-adaptive systems move decision-making from
   static, pre-defined commands to dynamic processes computed at
   runtime.</t>

   <t>Most autonomic systems use a closed control loop with feedback.
   Such control loops SHOULD be able to be dynamically changed at
   runtime to adapt to changing user needs, business goals, and
   changes in the ANI.</t>

   <t>The document <xref target="I-D.strassner-anima-control-loop"/> defines the
   requirements for an autonomic control loop, describes different
   types of control loops, and explains how control loops are used
   in an autonomic system.</t>
   
	</section>
	<!-- control-loops -->
	
	<section anchor="apis" title="APIs (*)">
	
   <t>Most APIs are static, meaning that they are pre-defined and
   represent an invariant mechanism for operating with data. An
   Autonomic Network SHOULD be able to use dynamic APIs in addition
   to static APIs.  </t>

   <t>A dynamic API is one that retrieves data using a generic
   mechanism, and then enables the client to navigate the retrieved
   data and operate on it. Such APIs typically use introspection 
   and/or reflection. Introspection enables software to examine the
   type and properties of an object at runtime, while reflection
   enables a program to manipulate the attributes, methods, and/or
   metadata of an object.</t>

   <t>APIs MUST be able to express and preserve semantics across
   different domains. For example, software contracts [Meyer97] are
   based on the principle that a software-intensive system, such as
   an Autonomic Network, is a set of communicating components whose
   interaction is based on precisely-defined specifications of the
   mutual obligations that interacting components must respect.
   This typically includes specifying:

   <list style="symbols">
	 <t>pre-conditions that MUST be satisfied before the method can
        start execution</t>

	 <t>post-conditions that MUST be satisfied when the method has
        finished execution</t>

     <t>invariant attributes that MUST NOT change during the execution
        of the method</t>

	<section anchor="data-model" title="Data Model (*)">

   <t>The following definitions are taken from [supa-model]:</t>

   <t>An information model is a representation of concepts of interest 
   to an environment in a form that is independent of data repository, 
   data definition language, query language, implementation language, 
   and protocol. In contrast, a data model is a representation of
   concepts of interest to an environment in a form that is dependent
   on data repository, data definition language, query language,
   implementation language, and protocol (typically, but not 
   necessarily, all three).</t>

   <t>The utility of an information model is to define objects and their
   relationships in a technology-neutral manner. This forms a
   consensual vocabulary that the ANI and ASAs can use. A data model
   is then a technology-specific mapping of all or part of the
   information model to be used by all or part of the system.</t>

   <t>A system may have multiple data models. Operational Support Systems,
   for example, typically have multiple types of repositories, such as
   SQL and NoSQL, to take advantage of the different properties of
   each. If multiple data models are required by an Autonomic System,
   then an information model SHOULD be used to ensure that the
   concepts of each data model can be related to each other without
   technological bias.</t>

   <t>A data model is essential for certain types of functions, such as
   a MRACL. More generally, a data model can be used to define the
   objects, attributes, methods, and relationships of a software
   system (e.g., the ANI, an autonomic node, or an ASA). A data
   model can be used to help design an API, as well as any language
   used to interface to the Autonomic Network.</t>

		<section anchor="coordination" title="Coordination Between Autonomic Functions (*)">
		  <section title="The Coordination Problem (*)">	
			<t>Different autonomic functions may conflict in setting certain parameters. For example, an energy efficiency function may want to shut down a redundant link, while a load balancing function would not want that to happen. The administrator must be able to understand and resolve such interactions, to steer autonomic network performance to a given (intended) operational point.</t>

			<t>Several interaction types may exist among autonomic functions, for example: 
			<list style="symbols">
			  <t>Cooperation: An autonomic function can improve the behavior or performance of another autonomic function, such as a traffic forecasting function used by a traffic allocation function. </t>
			  <t>Dependency: An autonomic function cannot work without another one being present or accessible in the autonomic network.</t>
			  <t>Conflict: A metric value conflict is a conflict where one metric is influenced by parameters of different autonomic functions. A parameter value conflict is a conflict where one parameter is modified by different autonomic functions. </t> 
			</list>  </t>

			<t>Solving the coordination problem beyond one-by-one cases can rapidly become intractable for large networks. Specifying a common functional block on coordination is a first step to address the problem in a systemic way. The coordination life-cycle consists in three states: 
			<list style="symbols">
			<t>At build-time, a "static interaction map" can be constructed on the relationship of functions and attributes. This map can be used to (pre-)define policies and priorities on identified conflicts.</t>
			<t>At deploy-time, autonomic functions are not yet active/acting on the network. A "dynamic interaction map" is created for each instance of each autonomic functions and on a per resource basis, including the actions performed and their relationships. This map provides the basis to identify conflicts that will happen at run-time, categorize them and plan for the appropriate coordination strategies/mechanisms.</t>
			<t>At run-time, when conflicts happen, arbitration is driven by the coordination strategies. Also new dependencies can be observed and inferred, resulting in an update of the dynamic interaction map and adaptation of the coordination strategies and mechanisms.</t>
			</list></t>

			<t>Multiple coordination strategies and mechanisms exists and can be devised. The set ranges from basic approaches such as random process or token-based process, to approaches based on time separation and hierarchical optimization, to more complex approaches such as multi-objective optimization, and other control theory approaches and algorithms family.</t>
		  </section>
		  
		  <section title="A Coordination Functional Block (*)">
			<t>A common coordination functional block is a desirable component of the ANIMA reference model. It provides a means to ensure network properties and predictable performance or behavior such as stability, and convergence, in the presence of several interacting autonomic functions.</t>
			<t>A common coordination function requires:
			  <list style="symbols">
				<t>A common description of autonomic functions, their attributes and life-cycle.</t>
				<t>A common representation of information and knowledge (e.g., interaction maps).</t>

		<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

		<section title="Threat Analysis">

<t>This is a preliminary outline of a threat analysis, to be expanded and made more specific as the various Autonomic Networking specifications evolve.</t>

<t>Since AN will hand over responsibility for network configuration from humans or centrally established management systems to fully distributed devices, the threat environment is also fully distributed. On the one hand, that means there is no single point of failure to act as an attractive target for bad actors. On the other hand, it means that potentially a single misbehaving autonomic device could launch a widespread attack, by misusing the distributed AN mechanisms. For example, a resource exhaustion attack could be launched by a single device requesting large amounts of that resource from all its peers, on behalf of a non-existent traffic load.
Alternatively it could simply send false information to its peers, for example by announcing resource exhaustion when this was not the case.
If security properties are managed autonomically, a misbehaving device could attempt a distributed attack by requesting all its peers to reduce security protections in some way. In general, since autonomic devices run without supervision, almost any kind of undesirable management action could in theory be attempted by a misbehaving device. </t>

<t>If it is possible for an unauthorised device to act as an autonomic device, or for a malicious third party to inject messages appearing to come from an autonomic device, all these same risks would apply. </t>

<t>If AN messages can be observed by a third party, they might reveal valuable information about network configuration, security precautions in use, individual users, and their traffic patterns. If encrypted, AN messages might still reveal some information via traffic analysis, but this would be quite limited (for example, this would be highly unlikely to reveal any specific information about user traffic). AN messages are liable to be exposed to third parties on any unprotected Layer 2 link, and to insider attacks even on protected Layer 2 links. </t>

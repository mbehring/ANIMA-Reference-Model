<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
	<t>The document "Autonomic Networking - Definitions and Design Goals" <xref target="RFC7575"/> explains the fundamental concepts behind Autonomic Networking, and defines the relevant terms in this space, as well as a high level reference model. <xref target="RFC7576"/> provides a gap analysis between traditional and autonomic approaches. </t>
<t>This document defines this reference model with more detail, to allow for functional and protocol specifications to be developed in an architecturally consistent, non-overlapping manner. While the document is written as generally as possible, the initial solutions are limited to the chartered scope of the WG.</t>
	<t>As discussed in <xref target="RFC7575"/>, the goal of this work is not to focus exclusively on fully autonomic nodes or networks. In reality, most networks will run with some autonomic functions, while the rest of the network is traditionally managed. This reference model allows for this hybrid approach. </t>
	<t>This document describes phase 1 of an Autonomic Networking solution, and covers primarily the WG items of the ANIMA WG as of July 2017. Sections marked with (*) do not represent chartered items at this time. New WG items will require an update to this document, or potentially a new document. </t>

<section anchor="network" title="The Network View">
	<t>This section describes the various elements in a network with autonomic functions, and how these entities work together, on a high level. Subsequent sections explain the detailed inside view for each of the autonomic network elements, as well as the network functions (or interfaces) between those elements. </t>
				
	<t><xref target="network-view"/> shows the high level view of an Autonomic Network. It consists of a number of autonomic nodes, which interact directly with each other. Those autonomic nodes provide a common set of capabilities across the network, called the "Autonomic Networking Infrastructure" (ANI). The ANI provides functions like naming, addressing, negotiation, synchronization, discovery and messaging. </t>
	
	<t>Autonomic functions typically span several, possibly all nodes in the network. The atomic entities of an autonomic function are called the "Autonomic Service Agents" (ASA), which are instantiated on nodes. </t>

			<t>This section describes an autonomic network element and its internal architecture. The reference model explained in the document <xref target="RFC7575">"Autonomic Networking - Definitions and Design Goals"</xref> shows the sources of information that an autonomic service agent can leverage: Self-knowledge, network knowledge (through discovery), Intent, and feedback loops.

			<t>The Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (lower part of <xref target="ref_model"/>) contains node specific data structures, for example trust information about itself and its peers, as well as a generic set of functions, independent of a particular usage. This infrastructure should be generic, and support a variety of Autonomic Service Agents (upper part of <xref target="ref_model"/>). The Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) is the summary of all interactions of the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure with other nodes and services.</t>
			
			<t>The use cases of "Autonomics" such as self-management, self-optimisation, etc, are implemented as Autonomic Service Agents. They use the services and data structures of the underlying Autonomic Networking Infrastructure, which should be self-managing. </t>
			
			<t>The "Basic Operating System Functions" include the "normal OS", including the network stack, security functions, etc. </t>

		   <t>Full AN nodes have the full Autonomic Networking Infrastructure, with the full functionality described in this document. At a later stage ANIMA may define a scope for constrained nodes with a reduced ANI and well-defined minimal functionality. They are currently out of scope. </t>

	<!-- element-architecture --> 

	<section anchor="adjacency-table" title="The Adjacency Table">

<!-- old section 5 start -->
	<t>Autonomic Networking is based on direct interactions between devices of a domain. The Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) is normally built on a hop-by-hop basis. Therefore, many interactions in the ANI are based on the ANI adjacency table. There are interactions that provide input into the adjacency table, and other interactions that leverage the information contained in it.</t>
	
	<t>The ANI adjacency table contains information about adjacent autonomic nodes, at a minimum: node-ID, IP address in data plane, IP address in ACP, domain, certificate. An autonomic node maintains this adjacency table up to date. The adjacency table only contains information about other nodes that are capable of Autonomic Networking; non-autonomic nodes are normally not tracked here. However, the information is tracked independently of the status of the peer nodes; specifically, it contains information about non-enrolled nodes, nodes of the same and other domains. The adjacency table may contain information about the validity and trust of the adjacent autonomic node's certificate, although all autonomic interactions must verify validity and trust independently.</t> 
	
	<t>The adjacency table is fed by the following inputs: 
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>Link local discovery: This interaction happens in the data plane, using IPv6 link local addressing only, because this addressing type is itself autonomic. This way the nodes learns about all autonomic nodes around itself. This is described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-grasp"/>.</t>
		<t>Vendor re-direct: A new device may receive information on where its home network is through a vendor based MASA re-direct; this is typically a routable address. See <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>. </t>
		<t>Non-autonomic input: A node may be configured manually with an autonomic peer; it could learn about autonomic nodes through DHCP options, DNS, and other non-autonomic mechanisms. Generally such non-autonomic mechansims require some administrator intervention. The key purpose is to by-pass a non-autonomic device or network. As this pertains to new devices, it is covered in Appendix A and B of <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>.</t>
	</list></t>
				
	<t>The adjacency table is defining the behaviour of an autonomic node: 
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>If the node has not bootstrapped into a domain (i.e., doesn't have a domain certificate), it rotates through all nodes in the adjacency table that claim to have a domain, and will attempt bootstrapping through them, one by one. One possible response is a vendor MASA re-direct, which will be entered into the adjacency table (see second bullet above). See <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>. </t>
		<t>If the adjacent node has the same domain, it will authenticate that adjacent node and, if successful, establish the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP). See <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane"/>.</t>
		<t>Once the node is part of the ACP of a domain, it will use GRASP discovery <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-grasp"/> to find Registrar(s) of its domain and potentially other services.</t>
		<t>If the node is part of an ACP and has discovered via GRASP at least one Registrar in its domain, it will start the "join assistant" ASA, and act as a join assistant for neighboring nodes that need to be bootstrapped. See <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>. </t>		
		<t>Other behaviours are possible, for example establishing the ACP also with devices of a sub-domain, to other domains, etc. Those will likely be controlled by Intent. They are outside scope for the moment. Note that Intent is distributed through the ACP; therefore, a node can only adapt Intent driven behaviour once it has joined the ACP. At the moment, ANIMA does not consider providing Intent outside the ACP; this can be considered later. </t> 
	</list></t>
	
	<t>Once a node has joined the ACP, it will also learn the ACP addresses of its adjacent nodes, and add them to the adjacency table, to allow for communication inside the ACP. Further autonomic domain interactions will now happen inside the ACP. At this moment, only negotiation / synchronization via GRASP <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-grasp"/> is being defined. (Note that GRASP runs in the data plane, as an input in building the adjacency table, as well as inside the ACP.) </t>
	
	<t>Autonomic Functions consist of Autonomic Service Agents (ASAs). They run logically above the AN Infrastructure, and may use the adjacency table, the ACP, negotiation and synchronization through GRASP in the ACP, Intent and other functions of the ANI. Since the ANI only provides autonomic interactions within a domain, autonomic functions can also use any other context on a node, specifically the global data plane. </t>

	<section anchor="state-machine" title="State Machine">

	<t>Autonomic Networking applies during the full life-cycle of a node. This section describes a state machine of an autonomic node, throughout its life.</t>

		<section anchor="state-1" title="State 1: Factory Default">
			<t>An autonomic node is leaving the factory in this state. In this state, the node has no domain specific configuration, specifically no LDevID, and could be used in any particular target network. It does however have a vendor/manufacturer specific ID, the IDevID <xref target="IDevID"></xref>. Nodes without IDevID cannot be autonomically and securely enrolled into a domain; they require manual pre-staging, in which case the pre-staging takes them directly to state 2.</t>

			<t>Transitions:
			<list style="symbols">
			<t>Bootstrap event: The device enrols into a domain; as part of this process it receives a domain identity (LDevID). If enrollment is successful, the next state is state 2. See <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/> Section 3 for details on enrollment.</t>
			</list> </t>
		</section>
		<!-- state-1 -->

		<section anchor="state-2" title="State 2: Enrolled">
			<t>An autonomic node is in the state "enrolled" if it has a domain identity (LDevID). It may have further configuration or state, for example if it had been in state 3 before, but lost all its ACP channels. The LDevID can only be removed from a device through a factory reset, which also removes all other state from the device. This ensures that a device has no stale domain specific state when entering the "enrolled" state from state 1.</t>

			<t>Transitions:
			<list style="symbols">
			<t>Joining ACP: The device establishes an ACP channel to an adjacent device. See <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane"/> for details. Next state: 3.</t>
			<t>Factory reset: A factory reset removes all configuration and the domain identity (LDevID) from the device. Next state: 1.</t>
			</list> </t>
		</section>
		<!-- state-2 -->

		<section anchor="state-3" title="State 3: In ACP">
			<t>In this state, the autonomic node has at least one ACP channel to another device. It can participate in further autonomic transactions, such as starting autonomic service agents. For example it must now enable the join assistant ASA, to help other devices to join the domain. Other conditions may apply to such interactions, for example to serve as a join assistant, the device must first discover a bootstrap Registrar. </t>

			<t>Transitions:
			<list style="symbols">
			<t>Leaving ACP: The device drops the last (or only) ACP channel to an adjacent device. Next state: 2.</t>

<section anchor="ani" title="The Autonomic Networking Infrastructure">		

	<t>The Autonomic Networking Infrastructure provides a layer of common functionality across an Autonomic Network. It provides the elementary functions and services, as well as extensions. An Autonomic Function, comprising of Autonomic Service Agents on nodes, uses the functions described in this section. </t> 

    <section anchor="naming" title="Naming">
	    <t>Inside a domain, each autonomic device should be assigned a unique name. The naming scheme should be consistent within a domain. Names are typically assigned by a Registrar at bootstrap time and persistent over the lifetime of the device. All Registrars in a domain must follow the same naming scheme.</t>
		<t>In the absence of a domain specific naming scheme, a default naming scheme should use the same logic as the addressing scheme discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane"/>. The device name is then composed of a Registrar ID (for example taking a MAC address of the Registrar) and a device number. An example name would then look like this: </t>
	<t>0123-4567-89ab-0001</t>
	<t>The first three fields are the MAC address, the fourth field is the sequential number for the device.</t>
    </section>
	<!-- naming -->

	<section anchor="addressing" title="Addressing">
	<t>Autonomic Service Agents (ASAs) need to communicate with each other, using the autonomic addressing of the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure of the node they reside on. This section describes the addressing approach of the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure, used by ASAs. </t>
	<t>Out of scope are addressing approaches for the data plane of the network, which may be configured and managed in the traditional way, or negotiated as a service of an ASA. One use case for such an autonomic function is described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-prefix-management"/>.</t>
		<t>Autonomic addressing is a function of the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (lower part of <xref target="ref_model"/>), specifically the Autonomic Control Plane. ASAs do not have their own addresses. They may use either API calls, or the autonomic addressing scheme of the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure. </t>

		<t>An autonomic addressing scheme has the following requirements: 
		<list style="symbols">
			<t>Zero-touch for simple networks: Simple networks should have complete self-management of addressing, and not require any central address management, tools, or address planning. </t>
			<t>Low-touch for complex networks: If complex networks require operator input for autonomic address management, it should be limited to high level guidance only, expressed in Intent.</t>
			<t>Flexibility: The addressing scheme must be flexible enough for nodes to be able to move around, for the network to grow, split and merge. </t>
			<t>Robustness: It should be as hard as possible for an administrator to negatively affect addressing (and thus connectivity) in the autonomic context. </t>
      <t>Stability: The addressing scheme should be as stable as possible. However, implementations need to be able to recover from unexpected address changes. </t>
			<t>Support for virtualization: Autonomic Nodes may support Autonomic Service Agents in different virtual machines or containers. The addressing scheme should support this architecture. </t>
			<t>Simplicity: To make engineering simpler, and to give the human administrator an easy way to trouble-shoot autonomic functions. </t>
			<t>Scale: The proposed scheme should work in any network of any size. </t> 
			<t>Upgradability: The scheme must be able to support different addressing concepts in the future. </t>
		</list>
		</t>
		<t>The proposed addressing scheme is described in the document "An Autonomic Control Plane" (<xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane"/>).</t>

	</section>
	<!-- addressing -->

	<section anchor="discovery" title="Discovery">
			<t>Traditionally, most of the information a node requires is provided through configuration or northbound interfaces. An autonomic function should rely on such northbound interfaces minimally or not at all, and therefore it needs to discover peers and other resources in the network. This section describes various discovery functions in an autonomic network.</t>

			<t>Discovering nodes and their properties and capabilities: A core function to establish an autonomic domain is the mutual discovery of autonomic nodes, primarily adjacent nodes and secondarily off-link peers. This may in principle either leverage existing discovery mechanisms, or use new mechanisms tailored to the autonomic context. An important point is that discovery must work in a network with no predefined topology, ideally no manual configuration of any kind, and with nodes starting up from factory condition or after any form of failure or sudden topology change.</t>
			
			<t>Discovering services: Network services such as AAA should also be discovered and not configured. Service discovery is required for such tasks. An autonomic network can either leverage existing service discovery functions, or use a new approach, or a mixture.</t>

			<t>Thus the discovery mechanism could either be fully integrated with autonomic signaling (next section) or could use an independent discovery mechanism such as DNS Service Discovery or Service Location Protocol. This choice could be made independently for each Autonomic Service Agent, although the infrastructure might require some minimal lowest common denominator (e.g., for discovering the security bootstrap mechanism, or the source of information distribution, <xref target="info-distri"/>).</t>
			
			<t>Phase 1 of Autonomic Networking uses GRASP for discovery, described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-grasp"/>.</t>
	</section>
	<!-- discovery -->

	<section anchor="negotiation" title="Signaling Between Autonomic Nodes">
			<t>Autonomic nodes must communicate with each other, for example to negotiate and/or synchronize technical objectives (i.e., network parameters) of any kind and complexity. This requires some form of signaling between autonomic nodes. Autonomic nodes implementing a specific use case might choose their own signaling protocol, as long as it fits the overall security model. However, in the general case, any pair of autonomic nodes might need to communicate, so there needs to be a generic protocol for this. A prerequisite for this is that autonomic nodes can discover each other without any preconfiguration, as mentioned above. To be generic, discovery and signaling must be able to handle any sort of technical objective, including ones that require complex data structures. The document "A Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP)" <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-grasp"/> describes more detailed requirements for discovery, negotiation and synchronization in an autonomic network. It also defines a protocol, GRASP, for this purpose, including an integrated but optional discovery protocol.</t>
			<t>GRASP is normally expected to run inside the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP; see <xref target="acp"/>) and to depend on the ACP for security.
			It <!-- is also capable of using TLS security in the absence of an ACP, and it -->may run insecurely for a short time during bootstrapping.</t>
			<t>An autonomic node will normally run a single instance of GRASP, used by multiple ASAs. However, scenarios where multiple instances of GRASP
			run in a single node, perhaps with different security properties, are not excluded. </t>

	<section anchor="routing" title="Routing">
		<t>All autonomic nodes in a domain must be able to communicate with each other, and with autonomic nodes outside their own domain. Therefore, an Autonomic Control Plane relies on a routing function. For Autonomic Networks to be interoperable, they must all support one common routing protocol. </t>
		<t>The routing protocol is defined in the ACP document <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane"/>.</t>
	</section>
	<!-- routing -->

	<section anchor="acp" title="The Autonomic Control Plane">

<section anchor="asa" title="Autonomic Service Agents (ASA)">
         <t>This section describes how autonomic services run on top of the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure.  </t>

	<section anchor="asa-general" title="General Description of an ASA">

<t>An Autonomic Service Agent (ASA) is defined in <xref target="RFC7575"/> as
"An agent implemented on an autonomic node
that implements an autonomic function, either in part (in the case of
a distributed function) or whole." Thus it is a process that makes use
of the features provided by the ANI to achieve its own goals, usually including
interaction with other ASAs via the GRASP protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-grasp"/> or otherwise.
Of course it also interacts with the specific targets of its function, using
any suitable mechanism.
Unless its function is very simple, the ASA will need to handle overlapping asynchronous operations. It may therefore be a quite
complex piece of software in its own right, forming part of the application layer
above the ANI. </t>

<t>Thus we can distinguish at least three classes of ASAs:
<list style="symbols">
 <t>Simple ASAs with a small footprint that could run anywhere.</t>
 <t>Complex, possibly multi-threaded ASAs that have a significant resource requirement and will only
    run on selected nodes.</t>
 <t>A few 'infrastructure ASAs' that use basic ANI features in support of the ANI itself,
    which must run in all autonomic nodes.
    These are outlined in the following sections.</t>
</list></t>

<!-- Paragraph moved from GRASP spec -->
<t>Autonomic nodes, and therefore their ASAs, will be self-aware.
Every autonomic node will be loaded with various functions and ASAs and will be
aware of its own capabilities, typically decided by the hardware,
firmware or pre-installed software. Its exact role may depend on
Intent and on the surrounding network behaviors, which may include 
forwarding behaviors, aggregation properties, topology location, bandwidth,
tunnel or translation properties, etc. The surrounding topology will
depend on the network planning. Following an initial discovery phase,
the device properties and those of its neighbors are the
foundation of the behavior of a specific
device. A device and its ASAs have no pre-configuration for the
particular network in which they are installed.</t>

<t>Since all ASAs will interact with the ANI, they will depend on appropriate application
programming interfaces (APIs). It is desirable that ASAs are portable between operating
systems, so these APIs need to be universal.
An API for GRASP is described in <xref target="I-D.liu-anima-grasp-api"/>. </t>

<t>ASAs will in general be designed and coded by experts in a particular technology
and use case, not by experts in the ANI and its components. Also, they
may be coded in a variety of programming languages, in particular including languages
that support object constructs as well as traditional variables and structures. The APIs
should be designed with these factors in mind.</t>

<t>It must be possible to run ASAs as non-privileged (user space) processes except for those
(such as the infrastructure ASAs) that necessarily require kernel privilege. Also, it is
highly desirable that ASAs can be dynamically loaded on a running node.</t>

<t>Since autonomic systems must be self-repairing, it is of great importance that ASAs are
coded using robust programming techniques. All run-time error conditions must be caught,
leading to suitable recovery actions, with a complete restart of the ASA as a last resort.
Conditions such as discovery failures or negotiation failures must be treated as routine,
with the ASA retrying the failed operation, preferably with an exponential back-off
in the case of persistent errors. When multiple threads are started within an ASA,
these threads must be monitored for failures and hangups, and appropriate action taken.
Attention must be given to garbage collection, so that ASAs never run out of resources.
There is assumed to be no human operator - again, in the worst case, every ASA must
be capable of restarting itself. </t>

<t>ASAs will automatically benefit from the security provided by the ANI, and specifically
by the ACP and by GRASP. However, beyond that, they are responsible for their own security,
especially when communicating with the specific targets of their function. Therefore,
the design of an ASA must include a security analysis beyond 'use ANI security.' </t>

<section anchor="management" title="Management and Programmability">
	<t>This section describes how an Autonomic Network is managed, and programmed.</t>
		
	<section anchor="management-general" title="Managing a (Partially) Autonomic Network">
		<t>Autonomic management usually co-exists with traditional management methods in most networks. Thus, autonomic behavior will be defined for individual functions in most environments. Examples for overlap are:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Autonomic functions can use traditional methods and protocols (e.g., SNMP and NETCONF) to perform management tasks, inside and outside the ACP;</t>
<t>Autonomic functions can conflict with behavior enforced by the same traditional methods and protocols;</t>
<t>Traditional functions can use the ACP, for example if reachability on the data plane is not (yet) established. </t>
</list></t>
		<t>The autonomic Intent is defined at a high level of abstraction. However, since it is necessary to address individual managed elements, autonomic management needs to communicate in lower-level interactions (e.g., commands and requests). For example, it is expected that the configuration of such elements be performed using NETCONF and YANG modules as well as the monitoring be executed through SNMP and MIBs.</t>
		<t>Conflict can occur between autonomic default behavior, autonomic Intent, traditional management methods. Conflict resolution is achieved in autonomic management through prioritization <xref target="RFC7575"/>. The rationale is that manual and node-based management have a higher priority over autonomic management. Thus, the autonomic default behavior has the lowest priority, then comes the autonomic Intent (medium priority), and, finally, the highest priority is taken by  node-specific network management methods, such as the use of command line interfaces. </t>

	<section anchor="intent" title="Intent (*)">
	<!-- In an ideal autonomic domain, only one intent provided by human administrators is necessary to operate such domain <xref target="RFC7576"/>-->
		<t>Intent is not covered by the ANIMA charter at the time of this writing. This section is for informational purposes only.</t>
		<t>This section gives an overview of Intent, and how it is managed. Intent and Policy-Based Network Management (PBNM) is already described inside the IETF (e.g., PCIM and SUPA) and in other SDOs (e.g., DMTF and TMF ZOOM). </t>
		<t>Intent can be described as an abstract, declarative, high-level policy used to operate an autonomic domain, such as an enterprise network <xref target="RFC7575"/>. Intent should be limited to high level guidance only, thus it does not directly define a policy for every network element separately. </t> 
		<t>Intent can be refined to lower level policies using different approaches. This is expected in order to adapt the Intent to the capabilities of managed devices. Intent may contain role or function information, which can be translated to specific nodes <xref target="RFC7575"/>. One of the possible refinements of the Intent is using Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules.</t>
		<t>Different parameters may be configured for Intent. These parameters are usually provided by the human operator. Some of these parameters can influence the behavior of specific autonomic functions as well as the way the Intent is used to manage the autonomic domain. </t>
		<t>Intent is discussed in more detail in <xref target="I-D.du-anima-an-intent"/>. Intent as well as other types of information are distributed via GRASP, see <xref target="I-D.liu-anima-grasp-distribution"/>.</t>
<!--		<t>Intent distribution is considered as one of the common control and management functions of an autonomic network <xref target="RFC7575"/>. Since distribution is fundamental for autonomic networking, it is necessary a mechanism to provision intent by all devices in a domain <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-grasp"/>. The distribution of Intent is function of the Autonomic Control Plane and several methods can be used to distribute Intent across an autonomic domain. Intent distribution might not use the ANIMA signaling protocol itself <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-grasp"/>, but there is a proposal to extend such protocol for intent delivery [draft-liu-anima-intent-distribution]. </t> -->

	<!-- The information gathering and the reporting delivery should be done through the autonomic control plane.-->
		<t>At the time of this writing, aggregated reporting is not in the ANIMA charter. This section is provided for information only.</t>
		<t>Autonomic Network should minimize the need for human intervention. In terms of how the network should behave, this is done through an autonomic Intent provided by the human administrator. In an analogous manner, the reports which describe the operational status of the network should aggregate the information produced in different network elements in order to present the effectiveness of autonomic Intent enforcement. Therefore, reporting in an autonomic network should happen on a network-wide basis <xref target="RFC7575"/>. </t>
	<!--These events can be produced considering traditional network management protocols, such as SNMP and syslog. -->
		<t>Several events can occur in an autonomic network in the same way they can happen in a traditional network. However, when reporting to a human administrator, such events should be aggregated to avoid advertisement about individual managed elements. In this context, algorithms may be used to determine what should be reported (e.g., filtering) and in which way and how different events are related to each other. Besides that, an event in an individual element can be compensated by changes in other elements to maintain a network-wide level which is described in the autonomic Intent. </t>
	<!-- An alternative to model this is the use of exception-based management <xref target="RFC7575"/>. -->	
		<t>Reporting in an autonomic network may be in the same abstraction level of the Intent. In this context, the visibility on current operational status of an autonomic network can be used to switch to different management modes. Despite the fact that autonomic management should minimize the need for user intervention, possibly there are some events that need to be addressed by human administrator actions.</t>

	<section anchor="feedback" title="Feedback Loops to NOC(*)">
		<t>Feedback loops are required in an autonomic network to allow the intervention of a human administrator or central control systems, while maintaining a default behaviour.

	<section anchor="control-loops" title="Control Loops (*)">
	
    <t>   Control loops are used in autonomic networking to provide a generic
   mechanism to enable the Autonomic System to adapt (on its own) to
   various factors that can change the goals that the autonomic network
   is trying to achieve, or how those goals are achieved. For example,
   as user needs, business goals, and the ANI itself changes, self-
   adaptation enables the ANI to change the services and resources it
   makes available to adapt to these changes.</t>

   <t>Control loops operate to continuously observe and collect data
   that enables the autonomic management system to understand changes
   to the behavior of the system being managed, and then provide
   actions to move the state of the system being managed toward a
   common goal. Self-adaptive systems move decision-making from
   static, pre-defined commands to dynamic processes computed at
   runtime.</t>

   <t>Most autonomic systems use a closed control loop with feedback.
   Such control loops should be able to be dynamically changed at
   runtime to adapt to changing user needs, business goals, and
   changes in the ANI.</t>

   <!-- <t>The document <xref target="I-D.strassner-anima-control-loops"/> defines the

	<section anchor="apis" title="APIs (*)">
	
   <t>Most APIs are static, meaning that they are pre-defined and
   represent an invariant mechanism for operating with data. An
   Autonomic Network should be able to use dynamic APIs in addition
   to static APIs.  </t>
   
   <t>A dynamic API is one that retrieves data using a generic
   mechanism, and then enables the client to navigate the retrieved
   data and operate on it. Such APIs typically use introspection 
   and/or reflection. Introspection enables software to examine the
   type and properties of an object at runtime, while reflection
   enables a program to manipulate the attributes, methods, and/or
   metadata of an object.</t>

   <t>APIs must be able to express and preserve the semantics of 
   data models. For example, software contracts <xref target="Meyer97"/> are
   based on the principle that a software-intensive system, such as
   an Autonomic Network, is a set of communicating components whose
   interaction is based on precisely-defined specifications of the
   mutual obligations that interacting components must respect.
   This typically includes specifying:

   <list style="symbols">

	<section anchor="data-model" title="Data Model (*)">

   <t>The following definitions are adapted from <xref target="I-D.ietf-supa-generic-policy-data-model"/>:</t>

   <t>An information model is a representation of concepts of interest 
   to an environment in a form that is independent of data repository, 
   data definition language, query language, implementation language, 
   and protocol. In contrast, a data model is a representation of
   concepts of interest to an environment in a form that is dependent
   on data repository, data definition language, query language,
   implementation language, and protocol (typically, but not 
   necessarily, all three).</t>

   <t>The utility of an information model is to define objects and their
   relationships in a technology-neutral manner. This forms a
   consensual vocabulary that the ANI and ASAs can use. A data model
   is then a technology-specific mapping of all or part of the
   information model to be used by all or part of the system.</t>

   <t>A system may have multiple data models. Operational Support Systems,
   for example, typically have multiple types of repositories, such as
   SQL and NoSQL, to take advantage of the different properties of
   each. If multiple data models are required by an Autonomic System,
   then an information model should be used to ensure that the
   concepts of each data model can be related to each other without
   technological bias.</t>

   <t>A data model is essential for certain types of functions, such as
   a MRACL. More generally, a data model can be used to define the
   objects, attributes, methods, and relationships of a software
   system (e.g., the ANI, an autonomic node, or an ASA). A data
   model can be used to help design an API, as well as any language
   used to interface to the Autonomic Network.</t>

		<section anchor="coordination" title="Coordination Between Autonomic Functions (*)">
		  <section title="The Coordination Problem (*)">	
			<t>Different autonomic functions may conflict in setting certain parameters. For example, an energy efficiency function may want to shut down a redundant link, while a load balancing function would not want that to happen. The administrator must be able to understand and resolve such interactions, to steer autonomic network performance to a given (intended) operational point.</t>

			<t>Several interaction types may exist among autonomic functions, for example: 
			<list style="symbols">
			  <t>Cooperation: An autonomic function can improve the behavior or performance of another autonomic function, such as a traffic forecasting function used by a traffic allocation function. </t>
			  <t>Dependency: An autonomic function cannot work without another one being present or accessible in the autonomic network.</t>
			  <t>Conflict: A metric value conflict is a conflict where one metric is influenced by parameters of different autonomic functions. A parameter value conflict is a conflict where one parameter is modified by different autonomic functions. </t> 
			</list>  </t>

			<t>Solving the coordination problem beyond one-by-one cases can rapidly become intractable for large networks. Specifying a common functional block on coordination is a first step to address the problem in a systemic way. The coordination life-cycle consists in three states: 
			<list style="symbols">
			<t>At build-time, a "static interaction map" can be constructed on the relationship of functions and attributes. This map can be used to (pre-)define policies and priorities on identified conflicts.</t>
			<t>At deploy-time, autonomic functions are not yet active/acting on the network. A "dynamic interaction map" is created for each instance of each autonomic functions and on a per resource basis, including the actions performed and their relationships. This map provides the basis to identify conflicts that will happen at run-time, categorize them and plan for the appropriate coordination strategies/mechanisms.</t>
			<t>At run-time, when conflicts happen, arbitration is driven by the coordination strategies. Also new dependencies can be observed and inferred, resulting in an update of the dynamic interaction map and adaptation of the coordination strategies and mechanisms.</t>
			</list></t>

			<t>Multiple coordination strategies and mechanisms exist and can be devised. The set ranges from basic approaches such as random process or token-based process, to approaches based on time separation and hierarchical optimization, to more complex approaches such as multi-objective optimization, and other control theory approaches and algorithms family.</t>

		<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>In this section we distinguish outsider and insider attacks. In an outsider attack all network elements and protocols are securely managed and operating, and an outside attacker can sniff packets in transit, inject and replay packets. In an insider attack, the attacker has access to an autonomic node or other means (e.g. remote code execution in the node by exploiting ACP-independent vulnerabilities in the node platform) to produce arbitrary payloads on the protected ACP channels.</t>
<t>If a system has vulnerabilities in the implementation or operation (configuration), an outside attacker can exploit such vulnerabilies to become an insider attacker.</t>

		<section title="Protection Against Outsider Attacks">

<t>Here, we assume that all systems involved in an autonomic network are secured and operated according to best current practices. These protection methods comprise traditional security implementation and operation methods (such as code security, strong randomization algorithms, strong passwords, etc.) as well as mechanisms specific to an autonomic network (such as a secured MASA service).</t>

<t>Traditional security methods for both implementation and operation are outside scope for this document.</t>

<t>AN specific protocols and methods must also follow traditional security methods, in that all packets that can be sniffed or injected by an outside attacker are:
<list style="symbols">
  <t>protected against modification.</t>
  <t>authenticated.</t>
  <t>protected against replay attacks.</t>
  <t>encrypted.</t>
  <t>and that the AN protocols are robust against packet drops and man-in-the-middle attacks.</t>
</list> 
</t>

<t>How these requirements are met is covered in the AN standards track documents that define the methods used, specifically <xref target='I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra'/>, <xref target='I-D.ietf-anima-grasp'/>, and <xref target='I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane'/>. </t>

<t>Most AN messages run inside the cryptographically protected ACP. The not protected AN messages outside the ACP are limited to a simple discovery method, defined in Section 2.5.2 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-anima-grasp'/>: The "Discovery Unsolicited Link-Local (DULL)" message, with detailed rules on its usage. </t>
<t>If AN messages can be observed by a third party, they might reveal valuable information about network configuration, security precautions in use, individual users, and their traffic patterns. If encrypted, AN messages might still reveal some information via traffic analysis, but this would be quite limited (for example, this would be highly unlikely to reveal any specific information about user traffic).  </t>

		</section>

		<section title="Risk of Insider Attacks">
<t>An autonomic network consists of autonomic devices that form a distributed self-managing system. Devices within a domain share a common trust anchor and thus implicitly trust each other. This means that any device inside a trust domain can by default use all distributed functions in the entire autonomic domain in a malicious way.</t>

<t>If an autonomic node or protocol has vulnerabilities or is not securely operated, an outside attacker has the following generic ways to take control of an autonomic network: <list style='symbols'>
  <t>Introducing a fake device into the trust domain, by subverting the authentication methods. This depends on the correct specification, implementation and operation of the AN protocols.</t>
  <t>Subverting a device which is already part of a trust domain, and modifying its behavior. This threat is not specific to the solution discussed in this document, and applies to all network solutions.  </t>
  <t>Exploiting potentially yet unknown protocol vulnerabilities in the AN or other protocols. Also this is a generic threat that applies to all network solutions.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The above threats are in principle comparable to other solutions: In the presence of design, implementation or operational errors, security is no longer guaranteed. However, the distributed nature of AN, specifically the Autonomic Control Plane, increases the threat surface significantly. For example, a compromised device may have full IP reachability to all other devices inside the ACP, and can use all AN methods and protocols. </t>

<t>For the next phase of the ANIMA work it is therefore recommended to introduce a sub-domain security model, to reduce the attack surface and not expose a full domain to a potential intruder. Furthermore, additional security mechanisms on the ASA level should be considered for high-risk autonomic functions. </t>
